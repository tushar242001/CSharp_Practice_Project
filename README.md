         The System namespace is the root namespace for fundamental types in C#.
         Collection of Classes, Interfaces, Structures, and Enumerations.
         Highly Cohesive and Loosely Coupled arrangement of classes.
Syste.Type
        This represents the Type
              A Declaration that has attributes (Properties) as well as Methods.
        System.Object, is the highest level type and all data tyeps are derived from it.
